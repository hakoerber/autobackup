Module to execute a command on a certain host. When you want to execute it on
the localhost, it behaves like a wrapper around then subprocess.Popen()
constructor to spawn a new process. If you want to execute a command on a remote
machine, the module will built up a commection to that host through the
connection class specified in _CONNECTION_CLASS and delegates the execution to
that class.

It also contains some functions to execute frequently needed processes, like
creating/deleting a directory or testing whether a file exists.
